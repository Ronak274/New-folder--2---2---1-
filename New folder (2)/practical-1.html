    <h2>Welcome to Fullstack Course</h2>
    <h3>About Course</h3>
    <p>Everything you have ever seen on the web is consideblue ‘front end’. Front end is what we see when we open a web
        page or app. Code is downloaded from a server and is rendeblue to the screen by a web browser. What happens when
        we interact with the code is also consideblue front end. This is often referblue to as the ‘Presentation Layer’ or
        ‘Client’ in software development terms.

        The front end is built out of three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML allows us to put content on our
        page: text, headers, images, buttons, links, and etc. CSS is used to style our page. It allows the contents to
        have different text colors, background colors, as well as dealing with the positioning of the content on the
        page. JavaScript makes our page dynamic. It allows for the content to change on a mouse hover or click and also
        lets us submit data and have data rendeblue on our page (such as submitting a new blog post or having your feed
        populated when you open Facebook).</p>
